Brainstorms are great at surfacing ideas—and terrible at guaranteeing decisions. You walk away with screenshots of whiteboards, vague next steps, and a Slack thread that fizzles out before anything ships.

High-trust teams run ideation like a pipeline: capture everything, triage quickly, and publish the action plan within 24 hours. Daily Pick brings fairness and speed to each stage so louder voices don’t hijack prioritization and every contributor sees where their idea landed.

## Stage 1: Collect Without Bias

Set up an async idea board (FigJam, Miro, Notion, physical stickies—you decide). Encourage quantity, not polish. Then use Daily Pick’s [Decision Wheel](/apps/wheel/) to randomly select which idea gets airtime first during your live session. This prevents “last comment wins” fights and ensures the quieter message in the corner still gets a hearing.

**Pro tips:**

*   Keep the wheel populated with unique idea IDs so duplicates don’t hog attention.
*   If you have 40+ inputs, batch them into themed wheels like “Customer Signals,” “Tech Debt,” or “Growth Bets.”

## Stage 2: Rapid Triage

Once an idea comes up, give it a 90-second pitch window followed by one clarifying question. Capture status in a simple tally:

*   🟢 **Advance:** Worth modeling or experimenting with.
*   🟡 **Park:** Needs more data, revisit later.
*   🔴 **Archive:** Doesn’t align with the current strategy.

Spin the wheel until every idea gets classified. The point isn’t to decide everything on the spot—it’s to make the funnel transparent.

## Stage 3: Prioritize with Intent

Move the 🟢 ideas into a prioritization showdown. Here’s a lightweight scoring approach:

1. Plot impact vs. effort in a shared doc.
2. Let Daily Pick choose which teammate speaks for each idea to avoid founder bias.
3. Vote in real time using emoji or planning poker values.

Daily Pick’s [Trap!](/apps/trap/) game ensures everyone advocates for exactly one idea before anyone gets a second turn. You’ll hear from ops, design, and support—not just product leads.

## Stage 4: Assign Owners Instantly

No action plan survives “we’ll follow up later.” Keep the momentum while energy is high:

*   Drop the prioritized list into a spreadsheet or Notion page.
*   Use Daily Pick to select a *starter* owner for each idea. Starter ≠ solo; they simply shepherd the next step.
*   For cross-team experiments, spin again to pick a partner or reviewer, making the work co-owned from day one.

## Stage 5: Publish the Decision Log

Within 24 hours, post a recap in Slack or your project hub:

*   Screenshot or export of the final board.
*   Status of each idea (Advance/Park/Archive) plus owner.
*   Date of the next checkpoint or experiment review.

Because Daily Pick’s draws happen inside your work channels, you’ve already got receipts showing that selection was fair, which builds trust over time.

## Sample Agenda (60 Minutes)

1. **00:00 – 05:00** Warm-up prompt + wheel spin to pick the meeting host.
2. **05:00 – 30:00** Idea spotlight roulette (Decision Wheel).
3. **30:00 – 45:00** Impact vs. Effort debate fueled by Trap! so everyone speaks once.
4. **45:00 – 55:00** Owner selection with wheel segments labeled by function.
5. **55:00 – 60:00** Next-step recap and Daily Pick spin for retro facilitator.

## Why This Works

*   **Visible fairness:** Random selection removes the “favorites list.”
*   **Faster output:** Clear stages mean ideas don’t rot in docs.
*   **Higher follow-through:** Immediate owner assignment eliminates action limbo.
*   **Better morale:** Contributors see exactly how their idea progressed, even if it was paused.

## Ready to Ship Decisions, Not Just Ideas?

Add Daily Pick to your brainstorm stack and watch ideation turn into action without debating who speaks next. Whether you’re in person, hybrid, or fully async, our selectors keep the energy high and the process transparent—so your best ideas don’t die in the comment section.
