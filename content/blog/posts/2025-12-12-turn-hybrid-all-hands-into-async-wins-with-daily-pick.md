If your hybrid all-hands still tries to cram every win, roadmap, and AMA into one live hour, you’re paying premium attention for a slideshow no one remembers. Async-friendly agendas flip the script: teammates consume updates on their schedule, then show up to the live session energized for connection, celebration, and quick decision-making.

Daily Pick customers use our selectors to choreograph speakers, rotate spotlight segments, and run participatory games that work for folks in-office, remote, or catching up later. Here’s how to rebuild your all-hands so it feels like a product you ship—not a meeting everyone endures.

## Step 1: Pre-Record the Broadcast

**Goal:** Ship the news package 48 hours before the live call.

*   Ask functional leads to drop short Looms or slides with narration.
*   Stitch them into a single 15–18 minute playlist.
*   Embed polls or simple forms for Q&A threads so people can react asynchronously.

Daily Pick tip: run the [Decision Wheel](/apps/wheel/) in your #all-hands Slack channel every month to choose which team owns the “deep dive” mini-documentary. Surprise producing rights keep the content fresh and accountable.

## Step 2: Design the Live 30 Minutes

Use the synchronous time for moments that actually need humans together.

1. **Cold Open (3 minutes):** Spin [Speedway Racer](/apps/speedway/) to randomly pick someone to share a personal win, DJ the intro music, or show the office dog. Instant energy, zero awkward “any volunteers?” pause.
2. **Celebrations (7 minutes):** Our [Trap!](/apps/trap/) game helps rotate kudos segments without repeating the same voices. Populate it with teams, customers, or initiatives you want to spotlight.
3. **Decision Sprint (10 minutes):** Surface one blocker or priority vote. Use the Decision Wheel with “Option A / Option B / Parking Lot” slices to close the loop in front of the org.
4. **Live AMA (10 minutes):** Pull the most-upvoted async questions, then let Daily Pick choose which exec answers first to keep responses crisp.

## Step 3: Extend the Ritual All Week

Hybrid orgs win when the all-hands isn’t “Thursday at 9” but a multi-day rhythm:

*   **Monday:** Publish the async broadcast, pin in Slack, and @channel the watch-by deadline.
*   **Tuesday:** Run a Daily Pick drawing for “Question Curators” who summarize the thread for leadership.
*   **Wednesday:** Reminder spin selects who hosts the cold open or playlist.
*   **Thursday:** Live session with cameras optional; recordings clipped and posted immediately.
*   **Friday:** Decision recap posted in #announcements, plus a wheel spin to choose next week’s ritual owner.

## Measuring Engagement That Matters

Look beyond attendance to prove the new format works:

*   **Pre-watch rate:** Track how many people finish the broadcast before the live call.
*   **Question diversity:** Count unique contributors in the AMA doc after you randomize curators.
*   **Decision velocity:** Log how many action items are closed within 48 hours of the all-hands.
*   **Sentiment pulse:** Use emoji reactions or a 2-question form (clarity + energy) to capture feedback.

When fairness and randomness are built in, teammates trust that their voices can surface without shouting over louder offices or time zones.

## Ship Your Best All-Hands Yet

Hybrid leaders don’t need longer meetings—they need rituals that scale attention. Daily Pick gives you the selectors to rotate hosts, crowdsource stories, and keep the live session energetic without burning precious calendar space. Plug our apps into Slack, Notion, or your streaming setup and turn your next all-hands into a launch-day experience your team actually looks forward to.
