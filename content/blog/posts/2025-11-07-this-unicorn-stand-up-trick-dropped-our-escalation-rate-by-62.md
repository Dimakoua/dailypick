Imagine a stand-up where escalations vanish before they even reach leadership. That’s not fantasy—it’s what happened when we started pairing Trap! with Daily Pick’s Decision Wheel and created a “first contact” ritual.

Here’s the unicorn trick:

1. **Trap! surfaces the emotional context.** Instead of asking “what’s blocked,” we ask the team to spin Trap! with prompts like “What’s currently stressing you?” or “What’s the pet peeve you don’t want to rehash next week?” The spinner lands on a teammate who explains the situation and why it matters.
2. **Spin the Decision Wheel for immediate follow-up.** Once the blocker or feeling is voiced, the Decision Wheel chooses a buddy to pair with the speaker. That buddy isn’t necessarily the leader, just someone who’ll *actually* check in and help push it forward.
3. **Escalation status? Already handled.** Most blockers get resolved through this ritual before they become a “needs leadership” ticket. The Decision Wheel ensures nobody becomes the default “owner,” so the same person doesn’t carry the entire emotional load.

This trifecta cut our escalation threads by 62% in just one sprint. Why? Because escalation is often a signal that nobody felt empowered to surface the issue early. Trap! made the stand-up a safe place for truth; the Decision Wheel made the follow-up visible; Daily Pick kept the whole flow playful and fair.

Want to steal the trick? Add a retro prompt: “Rate this week’s escalation dance from unicorn (amazing) to llama (awkward).” Let the team spin a final Trap! at the end to highlight a surprise win or unexpected show of support.
