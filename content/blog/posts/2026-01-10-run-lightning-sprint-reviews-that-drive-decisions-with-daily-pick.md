Sprint reviews often devolve into a slideshow of Jira tickets that nobody beyond the core team understands. High-performing squads treat the meeting as a product launch checkpoint: tight demos, clear decisions, and zero suspense about who speaks next. Daily Pick keeps the pace electrifying by rotating presenters, timeboxing segments, and forcing trade-offs live.

## The Lightning Review Blueprint

### 1. Publish the Demo Queue Early

Collect potential demos in a shared doc or channel. Include:

*   Feature name + outcome.
*   Persona or customer impacted.
*   One-liner ask (feedback, ship decision, unblock).

Populate a Daily Pick [Decision Wheel](/apps/wheel/) with each demo title. Share the wheel 24 hours before review so stakeholders can see what’s on deck and suggest additions.

### 2. Host the Spin at T-5 Minutes

Five minutes before review starts, run the wheel in #sprint-review to pick the presenter order. Turn on *block repeats* so no one demos twice until every item runs. Add a “Lightning Round” slice to represent optional quick hits if time allows.

### 3. Timebox with Purpose

Each presenter gets:

*   2 minutes to demo.
*   1 minute for questions.
*   1 minute to make/receive a decision.

If the team needs more discussion, Trap! decides whether it moves to Parking Lot or to the next sprint’s backlog refinement.

### 4. Close Decisions in the Room

Use Daily Pick to speed up contentious calls:

*   Wheel with options like “Ship Now,” “Hold for Data,” “Need VP Review.”
*   Spin to select which stakeholder speaks first so extroverts don’t dominate.
*   Run [Speedway Racer](/apps/speedway/) to pick an owner for follow-up tasks born from the review.

### 5. Capture Receipts Instantly

Assign a rotating “scribe” via Daily Pick at the start. They log:

*   Demo title.
*   Decision made.
*   Action owner + due date.

Post the summary thread within 10 minutes of the meeting ending to reinforce accountability.

## Sample 30-Minute Agenda

1. **Minute 0–2:** Wheel spin picks scribe and warm-up question.
2. **Minute 2–4:** Product lead recaps sprint goals vs. outcomes.
3. **Minute 4–26:** Demos ordered by wheel; Trap! handles overflow.
4. **Minute 26–28:** Decision recap + random pick for “customer shout-out.”
5. **Minute 28–30:** Spin selects retro action owner to ensure insights feed into the next sprint.

## Metrics Worth Tracking

*   **Decision rate:** % of demos that leave with a clear yes/no/next step.
*   **Stakeholder participation:** Count unique voices per review after randomization.
*   **Carryover items:** Track how often demos return because decisions lagged.
*   **Time to publish notes:** Should stay under 15 minutes when the ritual is tight.

## Tips for Distributed Teams

*   Embed the Decision Wheel in Miro or FigJam so remote viewers follow the order visually.
*   Record the spins and link them in the sprint doc for anyone watching async.
*   Use Daily Pick’s scheduler to pre-book Slack reminders for presenters 30 minutes prior.

## Ship Sprint Reviews People Crave

When everyone knows the rules and sees the randomness live, sprint reviews stop dragging and start shipping. Give Daily Pick your demo list, invite stakeholders to the spin, and watch the meeting transform into a fast, fair checkpoint that keeps momentum high between retros and planning sessions.
