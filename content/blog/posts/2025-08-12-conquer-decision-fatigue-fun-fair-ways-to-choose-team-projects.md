## Conquer Decision Fatigue: Fun & Fair Ways to Choose Team Projects

Project selection.  The mere mention can send shivers down the spines of team leaders everywhere.  Endless debates, clashing priorities, and the ever-present risk of someone feeling slighted – it's a recipe for meeting misery and decreased morale. But what if choosing team projects could actually be…fun?

This week, we're diving into the surprisingly simple solutions to a common team challenge: selecting projects fairly and efficiently, without sacrificing team enthusiasm. Pair these ideas with the momentum from [Banish Meeting Boredom: Fun Team Decision-Making That Works](/blog/banish-meeting-boredom-fun-team-decision-making-that-works/) so your rituals stay consistent across every meeting.

The traditional approaches – assigning projects based on seniority, skillset alone, or simply letting the loudest voice win – often lead to resentment and stifle creativity. They lack the crucial element of **fairness**, which is a cornerstone of positive team dynamics and productivity.

But there's a better way.  By incorporating a bit of fun and leveraging the power of unbiased decision-making tools, you can transform project selection from a dreaded task into an engaging team activity.

### Beyond the Brainstorm: Fun & Fair Project Selection Methods

Here are some practical strategies to make project selection a breeze:

**1. The Randomizer Revolution:**  Embrace the power of chance!  Tools like Daily Pick's **Decision Wheel** or even a simple random name picker can inject fairness into the process.  This removes the subjective biases that can creep in during discussions, ensuring everyone has an equal opportunity.  Use this method when there are multiple projects and multiple team members eager to volunteer.

**2. The Skill-Based Shuffle:**  Identify the key skills needed for each project.  Then, use a visual tool like a card sorting activity or a simple matrix to match team members with the most appropriate roles.  This approach ensures project success while giving team members a chance to work on projects that align with their strengths and interests.

**3. The Interest Auction:**  Let team members bid for projects based on their level of interest.  Instead of using money, they could "bid" with things like a promise to work extra hours on a particular task or the right to choose the project's meeting time.  This method is particularly effective for projects with varying levels of complexity or desirability.

**4. The "Speedway Racer" Approach:** If you're facing time constraints, utilize the fast-paced energy of Daily Pick's **Speedway Racer** game to swiftly assign projects.  This ensures participation and makes the decision-making process dynamic.

**5.  The Project "Trap":**  Use Daily Pick's **Trap** to add an element of surprise and excitement.  This is best when you have several members keen on taking on a particular project or if you want to create a healthy sense of competition.

**Integrating Fun into the Process:**

Remember, the goal isn't just to make decisions quickly, but to make the process enjoyable.  Consider adding a small reward or celebratory element, even if it's simply recognizing the successful project selection in your next stand-up meeting.


###  Beyond the Assignment: Fostering Collaboration

Once projects are assigned, ensure effective communication and collaboration.  Schedule regular check-ins and provide opportunities for team members to share updates and address challenges. This proactive approach prevents minor frustrations from escalating into larger problems.
