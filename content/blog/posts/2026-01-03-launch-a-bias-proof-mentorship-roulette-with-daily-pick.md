Traditional mentorship programs stall because matching happens once, manually, and usually favors whoever knows leadership best. High-growth orgs need a lightweight ritual that rotates connections, surfaces new perspectives, and proves the process is fair. Daily Pick gives people teams the roulette they need to keep pairings fresh without spreadsheets or favoritism.

## Set Your Mentorship Intent

Decide what you want this program to achieve:

*   Cross-pollinate knowledge between product and go-to-market teams.
*   Support ERGs with executive sponsors.
*   Give new managers more practice coaching.

Write a one-page brief outlining goals, cadence, and expectations. Drop the Daily Pick link you’ll use for matching so participants know exactly how pairs will be formed.

## Step-by-Step Mentorship Roulette

### 1. Collect Profiles

Use a short form to gather:

*   Name, function, timezone.
*   Topics they can teach vs. topics they want to learn.
*   Preferred cadence (monthly, bi-weekly).

Export the responses into two lists—mentors and mentees—or create a single mixed pool if you’re running peer mentorship.

### 2. Configure Your Wheel or Trap

In Daily Pick’s [Decision Wheel](/apps/wheel/), create segments that include both role and focus area (e.g., “Design Lead – Feedback Systems”). Turn on *remove winner* so a person isn’t paired twice in the same spin.

For larger pools, the [Trap!](/apps/trap/) game works beautifully because it eliminates names sequentially, making it clear who’s already paired and who’s still available.

### 3. Run the Live Draw

Host a 15-minute kickoff in Slack or a short video call:

1. Spin for mentor.
2. Spin for mentee.
3. Post the pairing inside a thread with suggested prompts.

Because the spins happen live, everyone sees the fairness baked in. If you’re async, record a short Loom of the spins and post the video with the pair list.

### 4. Automate Follow-Ups

After matches are announced:

*   Use Daily Pick’s Slack integration to DM both names with a template agenda.
*   Spin the wheel again to pick “Storytellers” who will share highlights in two weeks.
*   Add a reminder spin the day before sessions so no one forgets.

### 5. Rotate or Reset

At the end of a cycle (4–6 sessions), survey participants on usefulness and energy. If people want to stay matched, add a “Keep Pair” tile in the wheel; if it lands there, they continue another cycle. Otherwise, Trap! removes prior pairs so everyone meets someone new.

## Program Templates

**Leadership Lightning Chats**
*   30-minute monthly calls.
*   Wheel includes VP and Director slices plus emerging leaders.
*   Trap! ensures each exec meets every mentee before repeats.

**Cross-Functional Buddy Boost**
*   Pool includes ICs from engineering, design, product marketing, and CX.
*   Spins select one “Builder” plus one “Storyteller” to encourage mixed perspectives.

**New Hire Onboarding Roulette**
*   Run weekly for the first month of a cohort.
*   Decision Wheel picks a veteran “Guide” and a random culture prompt to discuss.

## Metrics to Share with Leadership

*   **Participation rate:** How many eligible teammates opted in.
*   **Pairing diversity:** Number of unique functions/timezones crossed per cycle.
*   **Sentiment score:** Quick poll after each session on value delivered.
*   **Retention correlation:** Track if participants stay longer or progress faster.

Because every assignment happens inside Daily Pick, you can export the history for audits or annual reports.
