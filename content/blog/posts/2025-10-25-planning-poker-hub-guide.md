## Why Planning Poker Still Works (When Done Right)

Planning Poker has stood the test of time for a reason. It combines collaboration, transparency, and consensus-building — all key to accurate agile estimation.  

But many teams fall into a few traps:
- Estimations take too long because discussions start *before* everyone’s voted.
- Remote teams struggle to keep things synchronized.
- The “reveal moment” is lost when votes aren’t hidden.

**Planning Poker Hub** fixes all that — and adds a sprinkle of fun while it’s at it. If you need a primer to share with stakeholders, the [Mountain Goat Software Planning Poker guide](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/planning-poker) explains why simultaneous reveals lead to better estimates—our Hub simply automates the experience.

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Enter your display name**  
   Each player starts by setting a name — no logins, just join and play.

2. **Create or join a room**  
   The host starts a new room, or teammates join using the unique room code.

3. **Add your story**  
   The host enters the Jira ticket or story name for context — everyone sees it live.

4. **Pick your card**  
   Each team member selects a Fibonacci card based on their estimate.

5. **Reveal together**  
   When ready, the host hits “Reveal,” and all votes appear at once — cue the discussion!

6. **Generate a Jira summary**  
   One click creates a clean summary you can paste directly into Jira comments or sprint notes.

## Why Teams Love It

### ⚡ No Setup, No Downloads
Start a room and share a link — that’s it. Everyone can join from their browser, no installations needed.

### 🧭 Keeps Everyone in Sync
Cards stay hidden until reveal, ensuring independent thinking and avoiding “vote anchoring.”

### 📋 Built for Jira
Copy neatly formatted summaries that your PMs (and Jira workflows) will love.

### 💬 Great for Remote Teams
Real-time collaboration means everyone’s always on the same page — even across time zones.

### 🧩 Host Handoff Safety
If the host leaves, the system auto-promotes the next participant. No lost rooms, no chaos.

- Rotate the host role each sprint to keep engagement high.
- Celebrate estimation wins — quick, aligned sessions deserve recognition!
