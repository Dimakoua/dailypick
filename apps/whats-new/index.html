            <h1>What's New in Daily Pick!</h1>
            <p>We've been busy adding new features and making improvements to help your team have more engaging and productive meetings. Here's a look at what's new.</p>

            <div class="feature-section">
                <h2>🔌 Integrations with Your Favorite Tools</h2>
                <p>Give your stand-ups instant context. Daily Pick now connects to your project management tools to sync your team and display relevant work, right inside the game.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Jira, Trello & GitHub:</strong> Sync your board members or repository contributors directly to the player list, saving setup time. When a player's turn comes up, their assigned tasks or issues automatically appear in the new "Stand-up Dock" for easy reference.</li>
                    <li><strong>Slack slash command:</strong> Launch any ritual from Slack with <code>/dailypick</code>, authenticate via the new Settings panel, and let teams jump into Planning Poker or morale checks without leaving chat.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Ready to supercharge your stand-ups? Connect your tools in the new <strong>"Integrations"</strong> section in your settings.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-section">
                <h2>🎲 New Games for Planning & Estimation</h2>
                <p>We've added a whole new category of games designed to make your sprint planning and estimation sessions more collaborative and fun.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Planning Poker Hub:</strong> A real-time estimation tool with hidden votes and Jira-ready summaries.</li>

            </div>

            <div class="feature-section">
                <h2>🎨 Brand Studio Gets Sections</h2>
                <p>The Settings & Brand Studio page has been reorganized so you can work in smaller chunks instead of scrolling through one massive form.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identity, Palette, and Themes:</strong> Each area is grouped into its own mini-card with context about what the fields power.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sticky Preview:</strong> On wider screens the live preview now stays visible as you edit, making it easier to see color and emoji changes immediately.</li>
                    <li><strong>Seasonal Controls:</strong> Holiday toggles sit inside their own section with clearer explanations and inline status messages.</li>
                </ul>

            <div class="feature-section">
                <h2>🃏 Planning Poker Hub Redesign</h2>
                <p>The multiplayer Planning Poker experience has been refreshed to feel more modern and easier to host.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Flexible layout:</strong> Host controls, deck selection, and vote states now live in a streamlined sidebar that adapts to desktop and tablet screens.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clearer summaries:</strong> Revealed rounds produce copy-ready summaries with averages and counts that paste directly into Jira or Slack.</li>
                    <li><strong>Session persistence:</strong> Player cursors, deck choice, and story labels stick around even if the host reloads, so you can resume estimation without re-setup.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Open <a href="/apps/planning-poker/">Planning Poker Hub</a> to spin up a new room and try the redesigned flow.</p>
