                <div class="guide-section">
                    <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>The goal of the game is to work together with other players to push the red ball into all of the
                        moving blue traps. The game is over when every trap has captured the ball.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="guide-section">
                    <h3>Controls</h3>
                    <p>Simply click anywhere on the game canvas. A force will be applied to the ball, pushing it away from
                        your click. The closer you click to the ball, the stronger the push.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="guide-section">
                    <h3>The Traps</h3>
                    <p>The blue circles on the screen are the traps. Each trap is assigned to a player name. When the ball
                        enters a trap, that player's name is added to the "Captured Players" list, and the trap disappears.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Special Effects</h3>
                    <p>Capturing a trap can trigger a random special effect that changes the game dynamics for a short
                        period. These include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Speed Boost: The ball's speed is dramatically increased.</li>
                        <li>Size Change: The ball becomes either much larger or smaller.</li>
                        <li>Trap Frenzy: All remaining traps move at a much faster speed.</li>

            <h1>Transform Your Team Meetings with Momentum Mayhem!</h1>
            <p>Looking for an engaging and fresh way to energize your daily standup meetings? Or perhaps
                you need a dynamic icebreaker for your team-building activities,
                Scrum ceremonies, or Agile retrospectives? Look no further than
                Momentum Mayhem, the real-time collaborative physics game designed to inject fun, energy,
                and teamwork into any group setting!</p>
    
            <h2>What is Momentum Mayhem?</h2>
            <p>Momentum Mayhem is an innovative online multiplayer game where players work together to
                achieve a shared goal. It's the perfect blend of physics-based gameplay and
                collaborative strategy, making it ideal for boosting communication and team cohesion. In
                this interactive browser game, you and your teammates collectively control a ball, aiming
                to guide it into moving traps. Each trap represents a participant, and successfully capturing a trap adds
                their name to the "captured" list, adding a playful twist to your team interactions.</p>
    
            <h2>Key Features for Enhanced Team Interaction:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Real-time Collaboration: Experience seamless synchronous gameplay as
                    all players contribute to controlling the same ball. This fosters immediate feedback and encourages
                    shared decision-making, perfect for remote teams and distributed
                        workforces.</li>
                <li>Engaging Physics Engine: The intuitive click-to-push mechanic provides a satisfying and
                    responsive gameplay experience. The closer you click to the ball, the more powerful your push, adding a
                    layer of strategic depth.</li>
                <li>Dynamic Traps and Player Assignment: Assign specific team members or
                    project roles to each trap, turning the game into a personalized experience. This can
                    be a playful way to determine the order of speakers in a standup or assign tasks.</li>
                <li>Chaotic Special Effects: Keep things exciting with unpredictable special effects like
                    Speed Boosts, Size Changes, and Trap Frenzy. These
                    random modifiers ensure no two games are exactly alike, promoting adaptability and quick thinking –
                    valuable traits in any project management environment.</li>
                <li>Easy Session Sharing: With a unique session URL, inviting your colleagues to join is
                    effortless. Momentum Mayhem is a fantastic virtual team-building game that requires no
                    downloads or complex setups.</li>
                <li>Customizable Player Names: Tailor the game to your team by entering individual names
                    for each trap. This personal touch makes the experience even more relevant for your sprint
                        planning or team bonding exercises.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>Beyond Daily Standups: Versatile Applications</h2>
            <p>While perfectly suited for daily Scrum meetings, Momentum Mayhem's versatility extends to
                various other scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Team Icebreakers: Start any meeting, workshop, or training session with a fun and
                    interactive activity to get everyone energized and engaged.</li>
                <li>Remote Team Engagement: Combat Zoom fatigue and foster a sense of connection among
                    geographically dispersed teams.</li>
                <li>Educational Tool: Use the game to demonstrate basic physics principles in an engaging
                    way for online learning environments.</li>
                <li>Casual Team Bonding: Simply enjoy a lighthearted gaming session with your colleagues
                    during a break or as a Friday afternoon activity.</li>
                <li>Brainstorming Sessions: The collaborative nature can even spark creative thinking
                    before a strategy session or problem-solving workshop.</li>
            </ul>
