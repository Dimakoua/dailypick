# Daily Pick Blog Overhaul Strategy

## Current State Analysis

### Analytics Insights
- **"8 fun standup meeting ideas"** - 42 clicks but 0 impressions (post exists but not ranking!)
- **"daily decision wheel"** - Only 5 impressions, 8 clicks
- **Most other queries** - Minimal impressions/traffic
- **Problem**: Content exists but isn't positioned for search visibility

### Current Blog Issues

#### 1. **Tool-Centric vs. Problem-Centric**
- Posts focus on "Daily Pick's [feature]" 
- Should focus on solving team problems FIRST, then show Daily Pick as solution
- Example: ❌ "Planning Poker Hub Guide" → ✅ "How to Run Effective Planning Poker Sessions (and why estimates fail)"

#### 2. **SEO Optimization Gaps**
- Titles don't match search queries
- Meta descriptions are generic
- Missing H2/H3 structure optimization
- No FAQ schema or featured snippet targets
- Canonical tags present but posts aren't competing for keywords

#### 3. **Content Gaps**
High-volume keywords NOT covered:
- "Standup meeting ideas" (42 clicks for "8 fun standup meeting ideas")
- "Remote standup best practices"
- "Agile retrospective games"
- "How to run standups" (evergreen, foundational)
- "Virtual meeting games"
- "Team bonding games"
- "Async standup alternatives"
- "Meeting facilitation tips"
- "Agile ceremonies explained"

#### 4. **Topic Clustering Issues**
Posts are scattered across similar topics:
- Multiple "fun/fair decision-making" posts
- Multiple "standup energizing" posts
- No clear content hierarchy

## Strategy Overhaul

### Phase 1: Optimization (2-3 weeks)

#### A. Create SEO-Focused Content Roadmap

**PRIORITY 1 - High Volume, High Intent Keywords:**

1. **"Standup Meeting Ideas"** (Target: Replace/enhance existing)
   - Current: "5 Fun Ways to Pick the Next Speaker in Stand-ups" (2025-06-10)
   - Issue: Only covers speaker selection, not full standup ideas
   - **Action**: Create comprehensive guide "8 Best Standup Meeting Ideas for Remote & In-Office Teams"
   - Structure:
     - What is a standup meeting
     - Why standups fail
     - 8 proven ideas (with examples)
     - Tools/games to implement
     - FAQ section
   - Target: 3000+ words, multiple H2/H3s, featured snippet

2. **"How to Run Effective Standups"** (New - Foundational)
   - Target: "How to run standups", "daily standup format", "standup best practices"
   - Structure:
     - Standup format 101 (15 min, 3 questions)
     - Common mistakes
     - Remote vs. in-office tips
     - Tools for automation (intro to Daily Pick)
     - Template/agenda

3. **"Agile Retrospective Games & Activities"** (New - Consolidate existing)
   - Combine insights from scattered posts
   - Target: "retrospective games", "retro activities", "standup games"
   - Focus on games that work for 5-50 person teams

4. **"Virtual Meeting Games for Team Engagement"** (New - Broader angle)
   - Target: "virtual team games", "zoom meeting games", "meeting engagement"
   - Link to Daily Pick games but position as broader category
   - Include non-Daily Pick alternatives too (shows authority)

**PRIORITY 2 - Decision-Making Keywords:**

5. **"Decision Fatigue: How Teams Make Better Choices Faster"** (New)
   - Target: "decision fatigue", "decision making frameworks"
   - Business-focused (not just fun)
   - Include research/data

6. **"Fair Ways to Assign Tasks & Rotate Responsibilities"** (New)
   - Target: "fair task assignment", "rotating responsibilities", "on-call rotations"
   - Practical guide with multiple methods

**PRIORITY 3 - Integration & Tool Posts:**

7. **"GitHub, Jira, Trello Integration Guides"** (Keep/Optimize)
   - These are fine but move to separate "Integrations" section
   - Help searchers find them in category

### Phase 2: Content Updates (Ongoing)

#### B. Optimize Existing Posts

**High-Priority Rewrites (Impact on rankings):**

| Post | Current Issue | Fix |
|------|---------------|-----|
| "Spice Up Your Standups: 5 Fun Ways" | Generic title | Target "standup speaker selection" specifically |
| "Planning Poker Hub Guide" | Too narrow (tool-specific) | Create broader "Planning Poker Best Practices" post that hints at tool |
| "Stop the Meeting Dread" | Competing with better "Standup Ideas" post | Consolidate or pivot to "Standup Anxiety" angle |
| "Retro Reboot" | Weak title | "Agile Retrospective Games: Complete Guide" |
| "Why Teams Skip Weekly Meeting Prep" | Clickbait angle | "Meeting Prep Automation Guide" (business benefit focus) |
